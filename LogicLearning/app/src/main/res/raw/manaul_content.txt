In order to add a particular element to the circuit grid, the user must choose the element they want to add from the UI menu. After the element has been selected, then the user can touch any part of the screen to begin dragging the selected element around the grid until they choose a grid square to drop it in.
To enable the move mode, the user must first select the Move button from the on screen UI menu. Once selected, the user may then select any one element on the circuit grid they would like to move and drag and drop that selected element on the circuit grid.
Tap and hold any element (excluding the light bulb) to drag wires directly from an output port of that selected element. Once a wire begins to drag from the selected elements output port then the user may drag it to an open input port location on the grid.
To save a schematic, the user must press on the save button. After the save button is selected, a new screen will appear where the user will be able to name that schematic to a specified save name they type in. To load a schematic, the user may press the load button and a new menu screen will show which saves are available to load. Then, the user can select any of the saves they have on file to load a schematic. It is important to note that saved schematics will not persist when the application is fully closed.
To evaluate/run a circuit, the system must not be performing any other UI menu button functions. If no other functions are being performed then the user can directly single tap a switch on the circuit grid and the system will evaluate the circuit. Based on the evaluation of the circuit the connected light bulb will be either in an on or off state.
